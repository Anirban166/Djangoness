A collection of personal notes extracted from some of my work for NAU-CCL. Primarily focused on full-stack development using Django on the backend and a handful of other technologies (PostgreSQL, React, Bootstrap, AWS, Apache, etc.).

> To be updated.

PS: I'm on a hiatus from writing blog posts. For the moment, I'm thinking to instead have standalone open-source repositories such as this for sharing some of my recent experiences in building software or playing with technologies.
